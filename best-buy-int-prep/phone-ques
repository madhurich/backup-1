performance best react, Virtual DOM
redux comparisions, shallow comparisions

2. challenges faced in testing
load the modules, simulate the actions, before they are tested, we need to mock it
for EX: for AJAX calls

spice, dumb components to be tested, we can spy them, if something has to be disabled

3. Team structures
7 developers -> 1, 3, 5, 7 and 13

14 people, 2 BA, 1 product owner, people from testing

3. How do you receive and track requirements,
track -> JIIRA
we have Product owner
