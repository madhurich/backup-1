Why we need 'State' for a component??

-> look into main.js, where we declared a functional component called 'clock' and rendered that, now in the page this particular view shows us a timer.
Which is done by executing the 'tick()' function, the 'clock' itself is not running the timer. WE are making the 'tick' function to be executed for every one second.

setInterval(tick, 1000);

Here 'tick' component is executed for every second, not the 'clock' component.

BUT BUT we need a component that updates it's time and that component must be re-rendered for every second. THIS IS THE place where we actually need to define our state.

This can be done by redefining the 'Clock' component as a classical component, where it offeres us a object called 'state' to be defined inside of the constructor.

class Clock extends React.Component{
	constructor(){
		super();
		this.state = {

		};
	}
};

> now we defined the state of the 'clock' component. 
> Now we need to change the state of 'clock' for every one second.
> To do that we need to run a 'setInterval' function that changes the state of 'clock' for every one second.
> So after the 'Clock' is rendered for the first time, is the place where we need to run this 'setInterval'. 'ComponentDidMount' is the exact place where we can run this setInterval.
> now seperately define the timer function that sets the state whihc is the 'date' value.

timer(){
	this.setState({
		date: new Date()
	});
}

Now we need to run this 'timer' inside of setInterval

setInterval(() => {
	this.timer()
}, 1000);

which is inside of 'componentDidMount' function.
> Now we also need to clear this interval function when the component is about to die.

for that reason, we assigned this setinterval function to a variable, and specify that varible inside of clearInterval.

this.toClear = setInterval(() => {
	this.timer()
}, 1000);

Though we are assigning the 'setInterval' to a varibale, that will be executed, we are just assigning it to some variable.

now inside of 
componentWillUnmount(){
	clearInterval(this.toClear);
}
