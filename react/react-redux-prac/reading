Here you connected, Header and Home components to redux, hence they are
considered to be 'smart components' and are placed inside of 'containers' folder.

--> you can also do like inside main put these 'header' and 'home' and just connect
'Main' to redux, then only Main will be inside of 'containers' folder and
Header, Home will be inside of 'components' folder 


IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER
before all these, npm install --save react-redux redux redux-logge

here you included 'redux-logger' in devDependencies thinking that 
logger is only for development purpose and not for testing.

	logger ---> redux-logger
	{createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers} ----> redux
	{connect} ----> redux
	{Provider} ---> react-redux
