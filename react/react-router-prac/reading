: Cannot find module 'webpack/bin/config-yargs'

You got this error, after you installed 'react-router'

and then you installed all the packages first by running 
--> npm install

then run the server 
----webpack-dev-server
now it worked

--> IMPORTANT
ERROR in ./components/Root.js
Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory' ./components/Header in C:\Users\madhu\Desktop\ints\react\react-router-prac\components
 @ ./components/Root.js 17:14-44

 you got this error, when you imported 'wrong path' within Root component

 you did --> import Header from './components/Header';
 but already Root is inside of components so you should write
 import Header from '/Header'; that's all

 -->IMPORTANT
 you got an error when you dint specify curly braces while importing 'Link'
 it should be 
 import {Link} from 'react-router';
 BUT BUT you dind import Link from 'react-router'--->WRONG WRONG WRONG
