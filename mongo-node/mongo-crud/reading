var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
var assert = require('assert');

var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test';
MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db){
	assert.equal(null, err);
	console.log('connected');
	db.close();
});

while using id, use it carefully
var ObjectID = require('mongodb').ObjectID; //this should be capital i and d, look at the case carefully.

var objectId= new ObjectID(req.params.id);
var obj = {"_id": objectId}

$$state, since its an I/O operation its a promise returned. So you need
to chain it to get the result.
