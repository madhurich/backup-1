2 some are usng

ng-model --> view to model chnages are observed
ng-bind --> model to view changes are observed

------
One way data binding
when we decalre a variable inside of the controller
$scope.name ="hello";
this can be dispalyed in the view using ng-bind="name", that means
we have a value decalred as a part of model and that is displayed on the view
which is just ONE way, there's no way that if we chnge the value in view that doesn't
change the value in the model.

Two way data binding
When we use ng-model="name" in the view, 
first when it is diaplayed on the page it will display the value that is declared in the
model which is "hello", later then when we change that input box that will also change the value in the model
