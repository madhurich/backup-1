in C datatypes
	int, float, char, boolean, short, long, double, byte
	class and objects

in javaScript
	number
	string - characters or strings
	boolean	- 0 or 1
	undefined
	object -key value
		--null , intentional absense of value
		it's an object's subtype.
		--array (arrays hold duplicate values and sequence is 
		important)
		here we are also considering 'function' as datatype

----
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
--class2
JAvascript doesnt support multithreading.
Java supports multi threading, this is used to process multiple CPU processes.
So when 

I/O operations, databse connection then JAvascript is used.
If Memory usage is considered then JAva is used

we can store integers as numbers in javascript (people mislead asking whether you can store integers in javascript).
REPL-read, eval, print, loop

its a linked data structure, and keys must be unique and they must be a string
and values can be anything(any data type)

Array -> stores sequence can hold duplicate values, each item can be of any datatype.

Function -> we have set of statements, can return a value, can accept parameters aso called as arguments

data types in JS

number
object
string
null
undefined
boolean
false
NaN
--difference between parameters and arguments
parameters are something which are given to the function decalaration or at
the time of declaration or definition.

Ex: function func(a, b){//-->here a and b are parameters
	return a + b;
}

func(2, 3); --> here 2 and 3 are arguments
