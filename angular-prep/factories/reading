only constants and instances are used in .run function
this is to prevent configuring the application while it is running.

.config accepts only providers, we cant inject factories or services in the configuration

factories-->
			return any kind of data type
			it has a 'return' keyword
			can be used to have reusable functionality
services--> returns an object
			it has 'this' key word
			can be used for to implement 'helper methods'
			it always creates an object instance, when ever created.

When to use Angular? When to use JQeury

Angular
when ever you have dynamic data to be dispalyed, when ever you have a specific data to be displayed in a specific place and there's lot of complexity invloved and when you want to keep track of changes that are taking place from time to time then you can use ANGULAR.

A conteoller is place where we can create a new child scope, and it can be attached to a specific view to have certain values declared in that controller

JQuery
when ever you have static data to be displayed, and the application is smaller and when you dont need to keep track of changes then JQuery is preferable.
