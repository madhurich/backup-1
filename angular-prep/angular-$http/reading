$http returns promise

When only $http is used without a promise
>When we define a service to get the data from the server using $http, it returns 
a promise and this promise is given to the controller and this returned promise handled
in the controller, and the response is handled in the controller itself

When $http used with $q
>When a factory is defined using $q, all the error handling is done inside of this
service itself and this response after it is refined is given to the controller
and then the controller don't need to handle the response if there's is any error.
This is more better option to define a request.
