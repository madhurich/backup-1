2. $window, $log

$log.log
$log.error
$log.info
$log.warn
$log.debug

3. link, pre-link and post-link
link: function(scope, element, attr, ctrl){
	
}

controller-->first
pre-link-->second
post-link-->third

if we specify link functions for a directive, first the link will be executed and then the template
will be rendered.
>if we have a scenario where we have parent directive and the child directive, we have link functions
in both the directives then the link function of child will be executed and then the link function
of parent is executed (link by default is treated as post-link)
>so if there's a scenario where we want to get some data from parent to child directive through this
link functions, the child link will be executed first and the parent will be the next, so here we
wont be able to access the data defined in the link of parent. So inorder to solve this problem
we have something called pre-link.
>convert the link of parent to pre and then put the remaining to same, now the parent link
will be executed and then the child link will b executed.
>but this is bad practice, so we have controller method.
DEcalre the controller in parent directive and put the data there, specify the argument "ctrl" in the link of 
parent function and require the parent controller by 
require: '^parent_directive_name'

IMPORTANT
>After creating the directive, Angulr compiles the directive and creates a new scope
instance of that directive and makes this scope available as a parameter to the link functions.
the compile function has 'template-element' and 'attribute' as arguments.
>Only after the directive is compiled it's corresponding link functions will be executed.
